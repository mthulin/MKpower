## Description
Power analysis and sample size calculation for Welch and Hsu 
(Hedderich and Sachs (2018), ISBN:978-3-662-56657-2) t tests including 
Monte-Carlo simulations of empirical power and type-I-error. Power and sample 
size calculation for Wilcoxon rank sum and signed rank tests via Monte-Carlo 
simulations. Power and sample size required for the evaluation of a diagnostic 
test(-system) (Flahault et al. (2005), <doi:10.1016/j.jclinepi.2004.12.009>; 
Dobbin and Simon (2007), <doi:10.1093/biostatistics/kxj036>) as well as for a 
single proportion (Fleiss et al. (2003), ISBN: 978-0-471-52629-2) and 
comparing two negative binomial rates (Zhu and Lakkis (2014), <doi:10.1002/sim.5947>).
